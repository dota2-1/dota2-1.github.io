			<div id="news-h1-text">Team Secret is one of the most famous and successful eSports teams in the Dota 2 discipline. Since its inception in 2014, the team has won many major tournaments and has managed to gain a large number of fans around the world. In our material we will tell the whole story of one of the strongest teams on the professional stage.

				<div id="news-changes">Team Secret was founded after August 27, 2014, about a month after the end of The International 2014. The founders of the team came from Ukraine Natus Vincere: Germany Kuro 'KuroKy' Salehi Tahasomi and Estonia Clement 'Puppey' Ivanov. They have long wanted to realize an idea, the essence of which was that the team should be managed directly by the players, and not by an e-sports organization. The composition of the team at the time of creation was as follows:
					<br>
					<br>• Kuro 'KuroKy' Salehi Tahasomi;
					<br>• Gustav 's4' Magnusson;
					<br>• Tal 'Fly' Isaac;
					<br>• Clement 'Puppey' Ivanov;
					<br>• Johan 'N0tail' Sundstein.
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>The first matches the team played in qualifying for the StarLadder StarSeries Season 10, where it won first place and secured a pass to the main stage of the tournament. Europe Team Secret took 3-4th place at ESL One New York 2014 and 2nd place at StarLadder StarSeries Season 10, losing 3: 2 to Evil Geniuses in the U.S. Grand Final. At The Summit 2, Europe Secret took third place, again losing to EG in the match against the USA. At XMG Captains Draft 2.0 and Dota Pit League Season 2, the team managed to take first place.
					<br>
					<br>At the beginning of 2015, changes took place in the team. Israel Tal 'Fly' Isaac and Denmark Johan 'N0tail' Sundstein left the team. Canada Arthur 'Arteezy' Babaev and Sweden Ludwig 'zai' Wahlberg left the United States Evil Geniuses to become the new Europe Team Secret players. The first tournament for the updated squad was Dota 2 Asia Championships 2015. Europe Secret did not lose a single match in the group stage and finished it in first place with 15 wins. As part of the playoff stage, the team managed to reach the final of the lower bracket, where they lost to the US team Evil Geniuses and took third place.
					<br>
					<br>In April 2015, Team Secret Europe did not perform very well at the StarLadder StarSeries Season 12, taking 7-8th place. But after the team won four tournaments in a row: Red Bull Battle Grounds: Dota 2, The Summit 3, MarsTV Dota 2 League 2015 Spring and ESL One Frankfurt 2015.
					<br>
					<br>At The International 2015 Europe, Team Secret performed not so well. After a relatively successful group stage, Europe Secret lost to China EHOME in the upper bracket, and then lost to Virtus.pro Russia in the third round of the lower bracket and took 7-8th place.

						<br>
						<br>During the transfer period after The International 2015 Europe, Team Secret radically changes its roster. The only player who remained on the team from the old roster is Puppey. Canada Arteezy left Europe Secret to join the United States Evil Geniuses again, and Sweden zai took an e-sports career break to graduate from high school. The new Team Secret Europe roster includes:
						<br>
						<br>• Jackie 'EternaLEnVy' Mao;
						<br>• Alivi 'w33' Omar;
						<br>• Rasmus 'MiSeRy' Philipsen;
						<br>• Clement 'Puppey' Ivanov;
						<br>• Johan 'pieliedie' Ostrem.
						<br>
						<br>
The first major tournament for the updated roster of the team becomes ESL One New York 2015, in which
Europe Secret took the second place, losing in the decisive match Russia Vega Squadron. Team Secret managed to take first place at the MLG World Finals and Nanyang Dota 2 Championships Europe.
<br>
<br>
Thanks to the successful start of the new eSports season, Team Secret went to The Frankfurt Major 2015 Europe as one of the main favorites of the tournament. The team moved quite confidently along the upper bracket and went to the grand finals, in which they lost to Europe OG and took second place.
<br>
<br>

After the major, the team’s results began to deteriorate. Europe Team Secret took 9-12 at the World Cyber ​​Arena 2015, 7-8 place at the MarsTV Dota 2 League 2015 Winter and 5-6 at the StarLadder i-League StarSeries Season 1. But in a couple of months the team will be able to become the winner of The Shanghai Major 2016 Beating Team Liquid in the Grand Final of Europe with a score of 3: 1.
<br>
<br>

On March 22, the team left Romania Alivi 'w33' Omar and Rasmus 'MiSeRy' Philipsen. New Europe Secret players become
Canada Arthur 'Arteezy' Babaev and US Saahil 'Universe' Arora. But after this, a series of not very successful performances awaits the team: Europe Team Secret took 5-8th place on the Dota Pit League Season 4, 5-6th place on ESL One Manila 2016 and 7-8th place on EPICENTER 2016. It turned out to be even less successful for the team The Manila Major 2016, in which the team took 13-16 places.
<br>
<br>

At The International 2016 Europe, Team Secret had to break through open qualifiers. But directly at the most important tournament of the year, the team failed to successfully perform. After the not-so-successful group stage, Europe Secret ended up in the bottom bracket, where China lost to PSG.LGD in the first match and finished the tournament in 13-16th place.

						<br>
						<br>
After an unsuccessful performance at The International 2016, changes took place in the team. August 27, 2016 Europe Team Secret introduced a roster for the new e-sports season:
<br>
<br>• Pio 'MP' Noah;
<br>• Zheng 'MidOne' Yek Nai;
<br>• San 'FoREv' Don Lee;
<br>• Clement 'Puppey' Ivanov;
<br>• Johan 'pieliedie' Ostrem.
<br>
<br>
The debut of the new composition was relatively unsuccessful. Europe Team Secret took 4th place in the Mars Dota 2 League 2016 Autumn and failed to qualify for The Boston Major 2016, losing in regional qualifications
Russia Virtus.pro.
<br>
<br>
November 6, South Korea San 'FoREv' Don Lee leaves the team, and Germany Maurice 'KheZu' Gutman takes his place. Thereafter
Europe Team Secret takes first place at ROG MASTERS 2016. But in the future, the team continues to decline in game form. Secret Europe failed to qualify for the Dota 2 Asia Championships 2017, took 5-6 place on the StarLadder i-League StarSeries Season 3 and 9-16 place on The Kiev Major 2017.
<br>
<br>
On May 4, the team leaves Sweden Johan 'pieliedie' Oström, Estonia Puppey becomes the fifth position player, as well as the new fourth position player in Europe. The secret team joins Jordan Yazid 'YapzOr' Jaradat.
<br>
<br>Secret takes 3-4th place at EPICENTER 2017 and 3rd place at DreamLeague Season 7. For the main tournament of the year, the team successfully passed through the European qualifiers, however, directly at The International 2017 itself
Team Secret Europe took 9-12th place.
<br>
<br>
In January 2020, Europe Team Secret took first place in DreamLeague Season 13: The Leipzig Major. In April, the team took 5-6th place in the twin division of the CIS - Europe at ESL One Los Angeles 2020 Online.
<br>
<br>
Currently, Europe Team Secret is participating in the WePlay! Pushka League Season 1: Division 1. We can only wish them good luck in the upcoming matches and watch the further successes of the team.
